# LSTM Model with MetaTrader 5 Integration

## Overview
This repository demonstrates how to integrate LSTM models with MetaTrader 5 (MT5) for time series forecasting.

## Contents

1. **Initialization and Connection to MetaTrader 5**
   - `lstm_model_tanh.ipynb`: Initialization and connection to MetaTrader 5.

2. **Data Retrieval and Dataset Creation**
   - Retrieving historical data from MetaTrader 5.
   - Creating and importing datasets for model training.

3. **Data Analysis**
   - Analyzing the retrieved data for insights.

4. **LSTM Model Creation and Training**
   - Implementing LSTM model architecture.
   - Training and testing the LSTM model.

5. **Model Saving**
   - Saving the trained LSTM model to `save_model`.

6. **Telegram Bot Integration**
   - `working_bot_telegram.ipynb`: Example code to create a Telegram bot.
   - Sending messages with actual data and predictions to Telegram.

## Usage
To replicate the process:
1. Ensure MetaTrader 5 is installed and configured.
2. Run `lstm_model_tanh.ipynb` to initialize connection, retrieve data, create datasets, analyze, train, and save the model.
3. Refer to `working_bot_telegram.ipynb` for setting up a Telegram bot to send messages with actual data and predictions.
